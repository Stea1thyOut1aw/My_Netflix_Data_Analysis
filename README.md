# My_Netflix_Data_Analysis
Here’s a complete, copy‑paste‑ready README.md tailored to the attached notebook, following widely accepted GitHub README best practices and data‑science documentation guidance. Each section is structured to help users understand, run, and extend the project effectively while aligning with GitHub’s formatting recommendations and common templates.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

# Netflix Data Analysis using Python

A concise, reproducible analysis of Netflix’s catalog using a Jupyter notebook. The project loads the public netflix_titles.csv dataset, explores content metadata (type, genres, ratings, countries, durations), and sets up a foundation for insights and recommendations for content strategy.[2][6]

## Features

- Single‑notebook workflow that downloads data, loads it with pandas, and explores key catalog attributes for movies and TV shows.[6][2]
- Clear environment setup using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn with reproducible defaults for visualization style.[5][6]
- Self‑contained dataset retrieval via gdown to ensure consistent inputs across environments for repeatable runs.[7][6]

## Project structure

- My_Netflix_MasterClass.ipynb — main analysis notebook with data download, EDA, and plotting setup.[2][6]
- netflix_titles.csv — dataset downloaded at runtime to the project root by the notebook using gdown (about 3.4 MB).[6][7]

## Getting started

1) Clone the repository and open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code with the Python extension enabled.[5][2]
2) Ensure Python 3.8+ and install dependencies (see below). The notebook will download netflix_titles.csv automatically via gdown when the first cell runs.[7][6]

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ with pip.[3][5]
- Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, gdown (installed in the active environment).[3][6]

Example install:
- pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn gdown.[3][5]

## How to run

- Launch Jupyter and open My_Netflix_MasterClass.ipynb, then run all cells in order (the dataset will be downloaded to ./netflix_titles.csv).[2][6]
- Alternatively, in VS Code: Open the folder, open the notebook, select a Python interpreter, and run cells sequentially from top to bottom for a clean, reproducible session.[5][3]

## Data

- Source: netflix_titles.csv, a widely used public dataset of Netflix catalog metadata (show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description).[8][6]
- Download: The notebook executes gdown to fetch the file into the repository root; no separate manual download is required.[6][7]

## What the notebook does

- Loads and previews the dataset shape and first rows to validate schema and completeness.[2][6]
- Sets seaborn visualization defaults and prepares for further EDA on content types, ratings, durations, and categories, enabling fast iteration on insights and figures.[4][6]

## Reproducibility tips

- Run notebooks from a clean environment and restart kernel before “Run All” to avoid stale state; pin package versions in a requirements.txt for consistent results across machines.[4][3]
- Consider exporting key outputs or intermediate artifacts, documenting versions, and tracking changes to the dataset location or schema in this README.[8][7]

## Suggested extensions

- Visualize distributions: content type mix, top genres in listed_in, ratings breakdown, release trends by year.[4][6]
- Regional insights: country coverage, co‑production counts, and geo‑specific rating mixes; consider mapping or normalized shares.[4][6]

## Contributing

- Open issues for bugs, enhancements, or questions; propose PRs with clear descriptions and minimal diffs.[1][7]
- For substantial changes, discuss via issue first; keep README and notebook in sync and follow semantic commit messages when possible.[7][4]

## License

- If redistributing, add an explicit license (e.g., MIT) for the code, and verify dataset terms before republishing the data; include data attribution if applicable.[8][3]

## Acknowledgments

- README structure and formatting aligned with GitHub’s documentation guidelines and community templates for clarity and navigation.[1][2]
- Data‑science README guidance inspired by reproducibility and transparency practices specific to notebooks and datasets.[6][8]

## Basic formatting notes

- Use headings, lists, and code fences for readability; prefer concise sections and include a short project overview at the top for quick scanning.[3][5]
- Keep this README current as the notebook evolves; outdated docs reduce usability and trust for collaborators and users.[3][4]
